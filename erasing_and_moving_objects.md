## Erasing things {#erasing-things}

Did you accidentally draw something in the wrong place? You can place, move, or delete things in your level by changing the tool selected from the **toolbar.**

To switch to deleting things, click on the **eraser tool** from the toolbar. Now click on anything you want to delete.

To switch back to drawing, select the **brush tool** from the toolbar.

**Note:** You can only delete things inside the currently selected layer. We'll talk more about layers in the next couple of steps.
