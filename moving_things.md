#Moving things

If you want to move something in your level without having to delete it and draw it again, you can use the **selection tool**.

Click on the selection tool from the toolbar (the selection tool looks like a mouse cursor), then click on something in your level.

Your selection should now have a border around it. Click and drag what youâ€™ve selected, and move it to a different position.
