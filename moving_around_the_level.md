### Moving around the level {#moving-around-the-level}

We can only see a part of this level, since it is larger than our screen.

To **move around the level** to see the rest of it, click on the **move tool** from the toolbar to the right of the sidebar, then click and drag on the level. (INSERT GIF HERE)
